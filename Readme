# 🚀 Universal Telegram Leech Bot

A powerful, containerized Telegram Bot designed to "leech" (download and re-upload) content from a vast array of sources including Direct Links, Torrents, Cloud Storage, and even Darknet (.onion) sites.

## ✨ Features

* **Torrent Support:** Download Magnet links and `.torrent` files via `Aria2`.
* **Cloud Integration:** Native support for Mega.nz and direct extraction from Google Drive/Dropbox.
* **Darknet Compatible:** Integrated Tor service to handle `.onion` and Torch search links.
* **Dockerized:** Simple one-command deployment using Docker and Docker Compose.
* **Fast Extraction:** Uses multi-connection downloading for maximum speed.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.10
* **Framework:** [Pyrogram](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) (MTProto API)
* **Download Engine:** [Aria2c](https://aria2.github.io/)
* **Privacy:** Tor (SOCKS5 Proxy)
* **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

* Docker and Docker Compose installed.
* Telegram `API_ID` and `API_HASH` (Get them from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)).
* A Bot Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leech-telegram-bot.git
cd leech-telegram-bot

```

### 3. Configuration

Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file or create a `.env` file with your credentials:

```yaml
environment:
  - API_ID=1234567
  - API_HASH=your_api_hash
  - BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token

```

### 4. Deployment

Start the bot using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build

```

## 📖 Usage

Once the bot is running, send the following commands in Telegram:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/start` | Check if the bot is alive. |
| `/leech <link>` | Download and upload any supported link. |
| `/help` | View detailed instructions and supported formats. |

**Supported Link Formats:**

* `https://...` (Direct Links)
* `magnet:?xt=...` (Magnet Links)
* `https://mega.nz/...` (Mega Links)
* `http://[hash].onion` (Darknet Links)

---

## ⚙️ How it Works

1. **Link Identification:** The bot parses the incoming URL to determine the protocol.
2. **Engine Routing:** * Torrents/Magnets are routed to **Aria2**.
* Onion links are routed through the local **Tor Proxy**.
* Mega links are handled via the **Mega-SDK**.


3. **Local Storage:** The file is downloaded to the `/app/downloads` volume.
4. **Telegram Upload:** The bot splits the file (if >2GB) and uploads it to your chat.
